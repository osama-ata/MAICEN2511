### Real Estate/Housing Datasets

- **Ames Housing Dataset (House Prices)** â€“ *Source:* [https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data](https:\www.kaggle.com\c\house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques\data) . This well-known dataset contains records of **over a thousand residential property sales in Ames, Iowa** , each described by dozens of features (e.g. lot size, building type, year built, quality ratings, neighborhood). It is highly relevant to **real estate and housing** in the AECO industry, as it captures detailed property characteristics and sale prices. **Prediction task:** Typically used for **house price prediction** (regression) â€“ the goal is to predict the **SalePrice** of a house from its features. The richness of features (about 79 variables) allows exploration of which factors drive property value, and one could also formulate classification tasks (e.g. predicting if a house price falls above/below a certain threshold).
- **New York City (NYC) Property Sales** â€“ *Source:* [NYC Gov Data via Kaggle](https:\www.kaggle.com\datasets\new-york-city\nyc-property-sales) . This is a public dataset of **New York City real estate transactions** , covering **one full year of property sales** across all five NYC boroughs (tens of thousands of records). It includes attributes such as building location (borough, block, lot), property type and building category, sale dates, and sale prices. **Relevance:** This dataset reflects real-world **urban real estate markets** â€“ useful for analyzing housing market trends, property values in different neighborhoods, and the factors influencing sale prices. **Prediction task:** It can support **regression** models to **predict property sale prices** based on features like location and building characteristics, or classification tasks (for example, categorizing properties into price brackets or predicting which properties are likely to be above a certain price).

### Building Performance (Energy) Datasets

- **UCI Energy Efficiency (Building Energy Load)** â€“ *Source:* [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https:\archive.ics.uci.edu\ml\datasets\Energy+efficiency) . This dataset comprises **hundreds of simulated building designs (768 samples)** with **8 different building parameters** (continuous and categorical, such as insulation thickness, orientation, glazing area, etc.) and records each designâ€™s **heating load and cooling load** requirements. **Relevance:** It addresses **building energy performance** , a key concern in AECO operations and sustainable building design. The data was generated from building simulation (using varying architectural features) to study energy efficiency, making it very suitable for exploring how design choices impact energy usage. **Prediction task:** It supports **regression** tasks â€“ for example, **predicting a buildingâ€™s heating and cooling energy consumption** from its design features. (One could also convert it to a classification task by categorizing buildings as â€œhighâ€ or â€œlowâ€ energy efficiency based on their loads.)
- **Building Energy Usage (Hourly Data)** â€“ *Source:* [Kaggle](https:\www.kaggle.com\datasets\programmer3\building-energy-usage-dataset) . This dataset provides **time-series data on building energy consumption** , with **7,200 hourly observations** of energy use. Each record includes **7 features** such as timestamp, building type (categorical), occupancy level, and weather conditions (temperature, humidity) alongside the recorded **energy consumption (kWh)** . **Relevance:** This dataset is directly tied to **building operations and performance** , as it reflects how factors like occupancy and weather affect energy usage in buildings (important for facilities management and sustainability in AECO). **Prediction task:** It is well-suited for **time-series regression or forecasting** â€“ e.g., **predicting future energy usage** based on past patterns and weather forecasts. It can also support classification tasks like detecting anomalies or classifying periods of high vs. low energy usage for optimizing building energy management.

### Construction Project Dataset

- **Construction Cost Estimation Dataset** â€“ *Source:* [Kaggle](https:\www.kaggle.com\datasets\sasakitetsuya\construction-estimation-data) . This is a **simulated construction projects dataset** with **1,000 project entries** , created for project analytics in the **construction domain** . Each entry includes several numeric features â€“ e.g. material cost, labor cost, profit margin, and any discount/markup â€“ as well as a text field describing the reason for cost adjustments (which can be used for NLP, though not required). All these factors sum up to a **Total Project Cost** field (the target). **Relevance:** It reflects **construction project budgeting and cost management** , a crucial aspect of project planning in the AECO industry. **Prediction task:** Primarily a **regression** problem â€“ you can **predict the total construction cost** of a project given the inputs like material, labor, and other costs. This helps in understanding cost drivers and can be used to improve project cost estimation or to identify risk of cost overruns (one could also frame it as a classification problem, e.g., predict if a project will go over-budget based on initial parameters).
