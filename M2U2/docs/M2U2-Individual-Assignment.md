# M2U2 | Individual Assignment

## Assignment Overview

Develop a Python tool that reads project data (site, materials, labor, duration) from a .csv file and outputs a summary cost report, highlights cost overruns, and flags potential delays.

(Optional) Add logic to forecast project cost if delay trends continue or “Export summary report to .txt or .csv using Python.”

## Deliverables

- Python script (.py or Notebook) that:
  - Loads structured project data (CSV).
  - Calculates total cost per site (materials + labour).
  - Compares actual vs. estimated values.
  - Highlights sites where the budget or timeline is exceeded.
- A simple .csv file with sample data.
- A summary report (printed or written to file).
